# Project 2

### - Describe continuous, ordinal and nominal data. Provide examples of each. Describe a model of your own construction that incorporates variables of each type of data. You are perfectly welcome to describe your model using english rather than mathematical notation if you prefer. Include hypothetical variables that represent your features and target.

Continuous data is numerical data that can take on a range of values. Example: temperature, income, or someone's height. 
Ordinal data is also numerical data, but unlike continuous data, only the order of ordinal values is important rather than their difference. Example: athletic ranking 
Nominal data is categorical like labels. Example: country, color, or  gender. 

A model that incorporate all types of data: result of a 50-meter dash on the Olympic Games. The country atheletes are from is nominal data. Athele's running time result is a continuous data. The ranking of their performance is ordinal data. In this model, the country and running time are features while the rank is the target which obviously depends on the running time.

|Athlete Name|Country|Time  | Rank   |
|-------------|--------|------|------|
|A  |   |   | |
|B| |   |   | | 
|C| |   |   | |
